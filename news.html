<section> <h5> Bandstand Sighted on Concession 8 - March 8, 2022 </h5> </section>
<section>
<p>This past Saturday, March 5, 2022, the Old Chamandy Memorial Bandstand allegedly made a brief appearance off the side of Concession Road 8. 
Donna St. Pierre, age 46, was walking her dogs in the early morning when she claims to have first spotted the structure on the edge of her family’s property. <br>
“I could see it, clear as anything, from where I stood on the road,” states St. Pierre, “[it was] right there against the treeline across the clearing, [the bandstand] looked like someone just built the whole thing over night.”
The Old Chamandy Memorial Bandstand was erected in the Robert E. Tremblay memorial park in July of 1922, to mark the ten year anniversary of the 1912 fire. During its two years of use, the bandstand hosted several community events and local musicians, maintained in top shape by contractors from the Greenlake Mining Co., representing project commissioner and company head Fredrick Dane. <br>
Since its ironic destruction in the 1924 fire, the structure has made brief appearances throughout town and the surrounding area. The first sighting is dated in October of 1931, reportedly spotted by three boys on a walk though McKay’s pit, now the site of Toal Golf Club, and a total of 28 reported sightings have since been reported. <br>
Sightings have regularly been accompanied by reports of strange animal behaviour and unpleasant smells. <br>
St. Pierre corroborates this, claiming that her two dogs were acting erratically before she noticed the bandstand’s presence.<br>
“Once we got a few feet out from the house, they started acting all skittish, and these dogs”, she explains “these two are tough as bricks, you know? Big babies with people, but they’ll charge a bear, I’ve never seen [them] like this, tails between the legs, fur all on edge.” <br>
St. Pierre goes on to say that her dog’s behaviour wasn’t the only indicator of something unusual. <br>
“I couldn’t hear any birds. Now, I know, I understand that it’s pretty early in the season. Winter likes to stick around a bit, you and I know that [laughs]. But still, we still have the chickadees and the- the crows hanging around, other ones that still make a whole ton of noise, but it was quiet. Absolutely nothing, like they all left, all I could hear was the wind and poor Lady here whining, and then the smell that the wind carried. Have you ever burned rotten wood? My folks had an old barn that we helped to tear down, just soaked through with mildew, we took all the scrap wood for a bonfire. Didn’t keep it burning long, it just reeked. This was worse. With the dogs scared, and the birds quiet and that smell, none of it felt right, I looked up and, yeah. There it was.” <br>
Despite the relatively high volume of reported sightings over the past several decades, only one photo of the structure has been collected by the Chamandy Public Library archive. Courtesy of Jackie Charon, the photo was taken on a digital camera in March of 2012, when the bandstand made an appearance on the War Memorial peninsula of Commander Lake. <br>
St Pierre states that she and her family will be paying close attention to the site of the appearance. <br>
“We thought about building another storage shed around there, I’m not so sure about that now. We’ll leave the spot empty and keep an eye out, just in case it feels like coming by again.”

<section> <h5> Teens Attacked by Bridge - July 28, 2021 </h5> </section>
<section>
<p> On the evening of July 26, 2021, a group of three Chamandy Secondary School students claim to have been attacked by the bridge on the Commander Lake peninsula. <br>
The grade 11 students, all of whom wish to remain anonymous, say that the attack took place around 11:30pm, when the three were out for a walk after a gathering with friends. <br>
When asked to specify how a non-sentient bridge could act aggressively towards them, one boy explained; <br>
“It didn’t, like, get up and hit us or anything, that’s not what I’m saying. It was psychological. An attack of the mind. It looked at us- not with eyes, but it looked nonetheless. It looked at us and it’s like my skull split. I didn’t know that a bridge could hate, but in this moment, it poured pure disdain into the empty cavity of my head and used the fat of my marrow to fuel the fire that it burned into my skeletal system.” <br>
This bridge is the second to sit on this particular plot on the Commander peninsula, constructed after the original was deemed unsafe to use in 2018. This is the first incident of its kind, but OPP and Tykwa Tagamou Nation Police Force have both stated that they intend to watch the bridge closely for future incidents. <br>
The boys insist that the attack was unprovoked, though one does admit to carving a phallic symbol into the paint. <br>
“It got mad because [redacted] was messing around.” Stated the same boy quoted above, “He defaced it, so it enacted revenge swift and ferociously. I’ve never been more afraid in my life, as it forced me to see, again and again, how immense its form and power is, compared to everything and everyone I’ve ever known. I would submit myself to torture by a thousand cuts before I ever behold the terrible truth of that bridge again. You don’t know pain; not like we do.” <br>
“I threw up.” Added another boy. <br>
All three are under watch by Red Squirrel Health Unit for continued psychological distress.
