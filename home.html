<section> <h4> The Town of Chamandy </h4> </section>
  <section> 
<p> In an isolateed corner of Ontario's north is Chamandy, a town founded by miners and fur traders in 1908. Chamandy boasts a rich community and thrilling history, often overlooked by our southern kin. Our town is unassuming, but unquestionably alive. Press an ear to the earth, feel her breathe and shift beeath the permafrost. That is Chamandy, our home, our coop, our keeper. </p> <br>

<section> <h5> About Project Chamandy </h5> </section>
<section>
<p> As a consequence of Northern Ontario's distance from the rest of ontario's population, our stories go untold. Project Chamandy is a response to this cultural blindspot, here to record the aspects of our home that go unsung. The unkown, the unexplained, the quiet labour of love that comes with living where we do. PC is commited to recording Chamandy history, both recent and removed, in the hopes that our written legacy will remain even once our Project founders do not.
