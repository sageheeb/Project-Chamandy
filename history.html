<section> <h5> The Flooding of Commander Lake </h5> </section>
<section>
<p> It is a little known fact that the town of Chamandy’s iconic Commander lake is a man-made feature. Situated at the heart of town, the lake has been a communal focal point for decades, acting as fairgrounds for the annual Chammandy Winter Carnival, and providing a space for locals to enjoy the outdoors. Despites its place as a Chamandy hallmark, the lake is relatively young, only having been completed in 1910, two years after the town’s incorporation.
The plot that would go on to host Commander lake began as a junkyard in Chamandy’s earliest days, a pit, hollowed out and used as a safe dumping ground for both settlers, and the nearby Greenlake Mining Co. project, which was in its infancy. <br>
Then-head of Greenlake Mining Co., Carlisle Dane, was the first to propose that the pit be filled and converted into a water feature, suggesting that some debris posed a potential danger as the mining operation unearthed matter from deeper below.<br>
In order to complete such a project, pipes were laid to transport water all the way from the Frederick House river, a task that took nearly a month to complete. 
On the day of the flooding, sandbags were placed around the pits perimeter to prevent overflowing, and a small team of three Greenlake Mining Co. workers worked together to turn the valve and allow the water to flow. Eyewitness accounts claim that the pit was not cleared prior to the water being released, meaning that the pit was flooded while still containing several year’s worth of debris. Unsubstantiated rumors purport that an entire train car, scrapped after being deemed unrepairable, was submerged as the lake was filled, and other rumors circulated that despite the high amount of waste within the pit, none floated to the surface once the lake was completely filled in. <br>
Witness claims have been recorded over time via correspondence, journal excerpts, and early news bulletins, briely loaned to PC for the sake of our records. Most reported similar experiences to what was listed above, but one account that we received stood out from the others. The following is an excerpt from a letter, dated July 18, 1910, three days after the lake project was completed. Written by Matthew Cote, a Greenlake Mining Co. laborer, the letter was addressed to his fiance, Joelle Demarce who was living in North Bay at the time. This record has been provided to PC and translated from French by Teresa Marking-Claire, a descendent of Mr. Cote on his brother’s side.<br>

<em>
My Joelle, <br>
I’m feeling restless. 
My time here has been taxing, but rewarding in ways that I could have never imagined. I’ve secured a plot for us, one with flat ground and shade from the spruce that surround it, perfect for a house. I’m making decent money, as you know, and the folks that settle here alongside me are familiar and honest, they’ll make good neighbors for us. I should be content with this life that I’m building for us, and weather aside, this land has been nothing but kind to me. If not for what we found in Fyman’s quarry. I’ve already put us in an uncomfortable position by describing it to you in my most recent letter, one that I hope you will dispose of now that I understand the weight of what I’ve disclosed to you, but I feel now that I owe you continued honesty. <br>
Since it was unearthed on that January day, I’ve thought of it often. I will spare you the finer details of what images it has left me to fight against, I know that Vic was as much a friend to you as he was brother in trade to me, but how he crumpled beneath its blow will continue to haunt me. The glow of its core leaves the memory illuminated in warm orange, a sickening contrast to the cold glint of its massive metallic claw. <br>
Once it was confined to a cask, the howling rage of the thing was not tempered. Thrice, during my first shift to watch over the thing, I saw sparks ignite, stronger than any match I’ve held, forcing myself and my cohorts to smother the flames that sprung up all around the kask, fed only by air. It escalated over time, the violence with which it lashed out at us, as I saw game become more scarce in the bush around the settlement, men who I once knew to be upstanding turn to liquor and cruelty. I know, Joelle, that it was the thing in the cask, wishing to punish us for waking it, for drawing it from its den, for ripping it from the cubs that slept in that narrow tunnel that we flooded with bitter water from the upper marshlands. I fear that we have earned this retribution. I don’t understand why we couldn’t leave it be, but with the money Mr. Dane gave those of us who volunteered in this effort, I bought the land that will house our future. <br>
And now, with its cask encased in cement and sunk beneath the surface of Commander, I can only hope that it's rage will cool. The dread that has yet to free itself from my gut keeps me from growing all too optimistic. I smell the iron heat of its breath, still. <br> </em>

The letter continues from there, without another mention of such a creature or any related incidents. It would, unfortunately, not be sent, as Mattthew Cote was killed in a tunnel collapse on July 21, two days before Canada Post was set to collect the outgoing mail. The letter was retained by Cote’s brother, Samuel. Matthew Cote's death record is available for viewing at the Chamandy Public Library Archive. <br>

<p> Wraith talk. It’s important to use cocoa butter. It’s the key to more success, why not live smooth? Why live rough? The first of the month is coming, we have to get money, we have no choice. It cost money to eat and they don’t want you to eat. To be successful you’ve got to work hard, to make history, simple, you’ve got to make it. Wraith talk. To succeed you must believe. When you believe, you will succeed. They key is to have every key, the key to open every door. </p>
